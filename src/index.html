          <p>
            In the near future around the American Midwest, Cooper, an
            ex-science engineer and pilot, is tied to his farming land with his
            daughter Murph and son Tom. As devastating sandstorms ravage Earth's
            crops, the people of Earth realize their life here is coming to an
            end as food begins to run out. Eventually stumbling upon a N.A.S.A.
            base 6 hours from Cooper's home, he is asked to go on a daring
            mission with a few other scientists into a wormhole because of
            Cooper's scientific intellect and ability to pilot aircraft unlike
            the other crew members. In order to find a new home while Earth
            decays, Cooper must decide to either stay, or risk never seeing his
            children again in order to save the human race by finding another
            habitable planet.
